## grapql4j


`GraphQL, a query language and execution engine originally created at Facebook in 2012 for describing the 
capabilities and requirements of data models for client‚Äêserver applications.
`

_We noticed that their where not many implementations in java which support this query language so we decided to do something about it._

## goal
__The goal of this project is to generate a datamodel from any graphql schema together with generating a query language model.__
